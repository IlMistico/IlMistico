- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paolo, I go by IlMistico on most of the tiny part of the Internet where I'm present.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software. I mean, I'm on GitHub, that's obvious right? More specifically, Python is my horse right now, but man, I discovered Rust and can;t get to learn it fast enough. Life always gets in the way of passions and interestes,, however, I aim to become proficient in it by the year. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... well, so much. I work in finance now, which is a brand new world for me both as data scientist and programmer. Ticks, futures, spoofing, order books... so much lingo!
 I am also learning Rust, because it's awesome :-) and also because I am good with Python (high level, interpreted, easy, slow, jack-of-all-trades, memory safe-ish), so being good with Rust (low level, compiled, hard, fast, memory safe-est) would give me a much needed sense of balance.
 Now, this is what I am actively studying: let's not go into what I would like to learn or this will become a looong list.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... well, thanks to GitHub's lack of a messaging service, let's just use my [email](mailto:paolo.merola89@gmail.com).


I plan to enrich my page with some side project, but most of what I work on is covered by some proprietary rule or whatever, so there's going to be just some side project. I am open to ideas for something to put here tho!

That is all. Dismissed.
