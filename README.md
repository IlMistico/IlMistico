- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paolo, I go by IlMistico on most of my tiny part of the Internet.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software. I mean, I'm on GitHub, that's obvious right? More specifically, Python is my horse right now. It seems like everything there is to do in programming can be done in Python, and most of it can be even done properly! So for now I'm here.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to properly build an online platform. With Python, most of the heavy lifting is done behind the scenes, which is great when you want to quickly get something done, but also means you don't really learn what happens behind an API or a database. Hope I'll know things better when I'll commit a new readme.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... well, don't. I Guess you could send me a message here on GitHub, but chances are I won't answer. I have space for a limited amount of people in my life, and I'm almost at capacity.
